The atom will implode  The fragile kingdom fold  The tremor becomes a quake  And there s a body in the lake  And as the two of us rebel  And damn you all to Hell  I wonder: is this all there is?    Time will help you through  But it doesn t have the time  To give you all the answers  To the never-ending why    As a sound of silence grows  As the spiders kiss is laid  The tumour becomes malign  But the kids are doing fine  And as the two of us rebel  And damn you all to Hell  I wonder: is this all there is?    Time will help you through  But it doesn t have the time  To give you all the answers  To the never-ending why    Time will help you through  But it doesn t have the time  To give you all the answers  To the never-ending why    Time will help you through  But it doesn t have the time  To give you all the answers  To the never-ending why    Time will help you through  But it doesn t have the time  To give you all the answers  To the never-ending why    Time will help you through  But it doesn t have the time  To give you all the answers  To the never-ending why

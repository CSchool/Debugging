I. The Observance  An Angel s kiss now fallen  Descending scarlet cuts the sky  Faded names left on the wall  Honor the fighting leave life to die  Remembered is the sacrifice but  No praisal of blood still flowing  Who were the leaders?  what controlled the Killing Hand  that caused this mourning?  Crossing over...    II. Ancient Renewal  Lowered deep into the sea  Being awaits to cleanse his soul  senses weakening time is still  Motionless by stiffening cold    The wheels race back and  Scorch his mind  Traveling all to find the land  Revelation warms a touch  And now, he will begin to  Understand    III. The Stray Seed  Extended a view to yesterday  Manifestation for none the same  Walking amidst a frightening still  No sound, no smoke, no scorching  Flames  He is risen...    Sipping his poison the raven sings  Yet another to add more bodies fallen  King from below  this one controls  the Killing Hand that caused this mourning.  Is it all over?  Is it all over?    IV. Thorns  Evil genius this secret plan  Mercy dealt with the losing hand  Will he ever fall? Can he end it all?  Our savior must make his stand.  Only a Prophet of  years to come  Wanting mortality I m all alone  He heard my voice  It was my choice I ve  stopped the Killing Hand.    V. Exodus  When I go back again  Will it be the same?  I ve stopped the cries  But now they know my name  The sea is calling me  my spirit must return  As I get closer,  was it really worth what I have learned?  I m in the valley  And the saddened chimes  I hear Race toward the wall to find one more name appears.  No one is left now  my one and only land  I laugh at what I ve done  I am the Killing Hand.

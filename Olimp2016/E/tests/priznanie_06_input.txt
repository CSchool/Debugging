 Verse One   No one knows  Just what has  Become of her  Shattered though  Desperate  Oh so Innocent  And delicate  But too damn moderate  To not admit  To let go  Broken down  Hurt again  It never ends  Frightened and  Trembling  Did she fall again?  An accident  Her eyes  Encircled in  Black again  I cant believe that  She s still with him      Chorus   For how long  Will you try?  How long until you  Walk away?  Your facade  Cant disguise  The fact that  You re in misery      Verse Two   Look inside  See what has  Become of her  Hiding within again  Can she pick herself  Up again?  It s just too difficult  And arduous  To let go  Homicide  Flashes through  Her mind again  No more pain  Take control  If he raises his  Hand again  She ll find the freedom  In killing him  The world will see that  She s had enough      Chorus   For how long  Will you try?  How long until you  Walk away?  Your facade  Cant disguise  The fact that  You re in misery     Verse     For how long  Will you try?  How long until you  Walk away?  From the look  In your eyes  I know you bleed  Internally...  For how long  You deny...  How long until you  Walk away?  Your facade  Cant disguise  The fact that  You re in misery  For how long  Will you try?  How long until you  Walk away?  From the look  In your eyes  I know you bleed  Internally...    Broken down  Hurt again  It never ends...

She was like April sky  Sunrise in her eyes  Child of light, shining star  Fire in her heart  Brightest day, melting  snow   Breaking through the chill  October and April    He was like frozen sky  In October night  Darkest cloud in the storm  Raining from his heart  Coldest snow, deepest chill  Tearing down his will  October and April    Like hate and love  World s apart  This fatal love was like poison right from the start  Like light and Dark  World s apart  This fatal love was like poison right from the start    We were like loaded guns  Sacrificed our lives    We were like love and undone  Craving to entwine    Fatal torch  Final thrill  Love was bound to Kill  October and April    Hate and love  World s apart  Light and Dark  World s apart  This fatal love was like poison right from the start    October and April  October and April  October and April

I was young,  I was told  I should follow my dreams  From my worse broken heart  To a world that just seems  To move on...  Dance with the wind,  Now she s gone.    I ve been down on my luck  Yeah I ve fallen from grace.  I ve had beautiful eyes stare me right in the face.  And move on...  Dance with the wind,  Now she s gone.    No need to talk about it.  Like it won t happen,   Cause the chances are that it will.    And moments like this will bring you down.  Moments like this will bring you round.  Moments like this will make you strong.  Now that they re gone.  Now they re gone.  Now that they re gone.  Now they re gone.    No more searching for signs  For a song I can sing.  Now I m living my life  Like a bird on a wing.  Movin  on...  Dance with the wind,  Feeling strong.    No need to talk about it.  Like it won t happen,   Cause the chances are that it will.    Try not to talk about it,  Just get it started.  Don t waste your time standing still.    And moments like this will bring you down.  Moments like this will bring you round.  Moments like this will make you strong.  Now that they re gone.  Now they re gone.  Now that they re gone.  Now they re gone.    And moments like this will bring you down.  Moments like this will bring you round.  Moments like this will make you strong.  Now that they re gone.  Now they re gone.  Now that they re gone.  Now they re gone.  Now that they re gone.  Now they re gone.    If it don t kill you, it makes you strong.  If it don t kill you, it makes you strong.  If it don t kill you, it makes you strong.  If it don t kill you, it makes you strong

I want your money honey  I don t want your body  Baby I don t need your love  I want your money honey  I don t want your body  Baby I don t need your love    I want your money honey  I don t want your body  Baby I don t need your love  Cause my heart is made of steel    I want your money honey  I don t want your body  Baby I don t need your love  Cause I don t believe in love    Love is a memory  That I keep on hiding deep in my soul  And every time I try save my heart  I loose myself so bad    Life is a mystery  No one knows the secrets do brake trough  And every time I try to change my ways  I find myself alone    I don t know what to do  All alone sad and blue  I never be that fool    I leave the misery  I don t want to fight for love anymore  And every time I think of yesterday  I see how it was wrong    I know my destiny  I don t want to shed my tears anymore  And every time I think of all my pain  I know that I m strong    Now I know what to do  Don t wanna feel so blue  I never be that fool    Cause I don t  Believe  Cause I don t belive  Cause I don t    I want your money honey  I don t want your body  Baby I don t need your love
